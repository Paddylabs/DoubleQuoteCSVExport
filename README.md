# DoubleQuoteCSVExport
Visual Basic Macro that will export values from a CSV file and enclose them in double quotes and save to CSV file.

I take no credit for this as I was introduced to the concept (and requirement for it) by a colleague and found this version on a forum I can no longer find and there are numerous examples of the same thing out there anyway.

Quite often you can be dealing with special characters and / or spaces and such that will break PowerShell scripts or data imports etc.  This macro will export your data from excel into a comma delimited file with all values enclosed in double quotes.  

To have this available at all times import the .bas file via the Developer Tab, Visual Basic Button.  After its been imported you need to close Visual Basic and return to your Workbook, click the Macros Button and save the CSV Macro to your Personal Macro Workbook. (If you do not have a personal macro workbook you will need to create one).

The CSV Macro should now be available in all new workbooks.
