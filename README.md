# DoubleQuoteCSVExport
Visual Basic Macro that will export values from a CSV file and enclose them in double quotes and save to CSV file.

I take no credit for this as I was introduced to the concept (and requirement for it) by a colleague and found this version on a forum I can no longer find and there are numerous examples of the same thing out there anyway.

Quite often you can be dealing with special characters and / or spaces and such that will break PowerShell scripts or data imports etc.  This macro will export your data from excel into a comma delimited file with all values enclosed in double quotes.  

To have this available at all times import the .bas file via the Developer Tab, Visual Basic Button.  After its been imported you need to close Visual Basic and return to your Workbook, click the Macros Button and save the CSV Macro to your Personal Macro Workbook. (If you do not have a personal macro workbook you will need to create one).

The CSV Macro should now be available in all new workbooks.

My GitHub repositories are really just a collection of scripts and tools I've found and amended to suit my purposes or ones I've attempted to write from scratch to fulfil a requirement I've had at a particular time.

I started to use GitHub as I realised that I needed somewhere I could keep code so I could refer back to, to jog my memory on how to do things or to reuse so that I wasn't reinventing my wheel. (I say 'my' wheel as I'm not arrogant enough to think that any of my scripts could be 'the' wheel.)

Also, any suggestions on improvements to these scripts or better ways to do things are greatly appreciated. We're all standing on the shoulders on giants.... and I need more giants!
